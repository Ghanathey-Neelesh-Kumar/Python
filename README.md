# Python Operators

Python operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Here are some of the types of operators commonly used in Python:

## Arithmetic Operator
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations. Examples include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), etc.

## Relational/Comparison Operator
Relational operators are used to compare two values. Examples include equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), etc.

## Assignment Operator
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Examples include equals (=), plus equals (+=), minus equals (-=), etc.

## Logical Operator
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. Examples include and, or, not.

## Membership Operator
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is present in an object. Examples include in, not in.

## Identity Operator
Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. Examples include is, is not.

## Bitwise Operator
Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers. Examples include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^).

### Note:
- Variable declaration is implicit in Python.
- Operator precedence: not > and > or.
